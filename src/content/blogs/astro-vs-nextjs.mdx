# Astro vs. Next.js: Which Framework is Best for Your Project?

Choosing between Astro and Next.js can be tough, as both frameworks are incredibly powerful. However, the key difference lies in their approach to performance.

- **Astro**: Designed to minimize JavaScript and maximize speed, Astro is ideal for content-focused sites like blogs, landing pages, and documentation.
- **Next.js**: A more feature-rich framework with server-side rendering and API routes, Next.js is better suited for complex, dynamic web applications.

## When to Choose Astro

- You need a fast, static site with minimal client-side JavaScript.
- Your project is content-heavy, like a blog or portfolio.

## When to Choose Next.js

- Youâ€™re building a dynamic app with server-side logic.
- You require API routes or advanced routing features.
